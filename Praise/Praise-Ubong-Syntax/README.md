## Overview

**Syntax** is a web application built on the **Internet Computer (ICP)** platform, designed to provide **three** main functionalities: **Grammar Checking**, **CV Enhancement** and **ATS Capabilities**. The application utilizes **artificial intelligence (AI)** to perform grammar checks on text and optimize CVs (resumes) to better match specific job descriptions. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the application, detailing its functionalities, architecture, and the technologies used in its development.


## Key Features

1. **Grammar Checker:** Allows users to paste text and receive feedback on syntactic and grammatical errors, along with suggestions for improvement and a rewritten version of the text.

2. **CV Enhancer:** Enables users to optimize their CVs based on a job description by highlighting relevant skills, rewriting work experience sections, and generating a professional summary tailored to the job.experience, summary, and skills.

<!-- 3. **ATS-Friendly Resume Formatting:** The app offers customizable templates to ensure compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems.

4. **Multi-Language Support:** The app initially supports popular languages, with plans for expansion to others. -->


## Architecture

**Syntax** is an Internet Computer (ICP) application, which means it is hosted on a decentralized network that provides scalability and security for web services. The application comprises two main components:

1. **`Frontend`:** Built using **React.js**, the frontend provides a user interface (UI) for interacting with the grammar checker and CV enhancer. It handles user input and displays analysis results from the backend services.

2. **`Backend`:** Developed in **Rust**, the backend is deployed as a canister on the Internet Computer. It processes requests for grammar analysis and CV enhancement and stores the results.

### Tools and Technologies

  -  **`Internet Computer (ICP)`::** The underlying platform provides a decentralized environment for hosting the app's services.
  -  **`Backend`:** `Rust` The primary language used for backend development, offering safety and performance benefits. The backend handles processing for grammar and CV analyses.. 
  -  **`Frontend`:** `React.js` A JavaScript library used for building the user interface of the web application..
  -  **`Libraries`:** React Router, React Router Dom.
  -  **`Authorization`:** `Internet Identity`.
  -  **`Function Service Endpoint and Proxy`:** FastAPI (Python) deployed on Fly.io
  -  **`AI Model`:** OpenAI GPT 3.5


## Functionalities and Workflow

1. **Grammar Checker**
The Grammar Checker allows users to analyze text for grammatical correctness and style. Here's how it works:
   - **`User Input`** The user pastes a paragraph of text into the grammar checker interface.
   - **`Analysis Request`** Upon clicking `Analyze`, a request is sent to the backend AI service to process the text.
   - **`AI Processing`**: The backend service analyzes the text for `grammatical and syntactic errors`, provides suggestions for improvements, and generates a rewritten version of the text.
   - **`Result Display`**: The results are sent back to the frontend, where users can view grammatical errors, syntactic errors, suggestions, and the rewritten text.

    ### Backend Definition for Grammar Analysis:
      - **Data Structures:**
         - `GrammarUserInput`: Contains the user-provided text for analysis.
         - `GrammarCheckResult`: Includes details about grammatical errors, syntactic errors, suggestions, and a rewritten version of the text.
         - `GrammarAnalysisResponse`: Combines the request and result, indexed by a unique identifier.
         - `GrammarResponse`: A variant type representing either a successful result (Ok) or an error (Err).

      - **Backend Functions:**
         - `analyze_grammar`: Accepts a text index and GrammarUserInput, returns a GrammarResponse.
         - `get_grammar_analysis`: Retrieves a specific grammar analysis based on index and user identifier.
         - `get_all_grammar_analysis_for_identity`: Fetches all grammar analyses for a specific user identity.
         - `delete_grammar_analysis`: Deletes a specific grammar analysis based on index and user identifier.

2. **CV Enhancer**
The CV Enhancer is designed to help users tailor their CVs to match a job description more effectively. Hereâ€™s how it functions:
   - **`User Input`**: Users provide a job description, job title, and their CV (or relevant sections) through the UI.
   - **`Analysis Request`**: After inputting the necessary information, the user initiates the CV enhancement process.
   - **`AI Processing`**: The backend service analyzes the CV in the context of the provided job description and job title. It identifies relevant
   - **`skills`**, rewrites work experience sections, and generates a professional summary that aligns with the job description.
   - **`Result Display`**: The results are returned to the frontend, highlighting key skills, providing rewritten work experience, and a professional summary. Users can download the enhanced CV or make further adjustments.

   ### Backend Definition for CV Analysis:
      - **Data Structures:**
         - `CVUserInput`: Contains the job title, job description, and CV text provided by the user.
         - `AnalysisResult`: Includes the extracted and highlighted skills, rewritten work experience, and a professional summary.
         - `CVAnalysisResponse`: Combines the request and result, indexed by a unique identifier.
         - `CVResponse`: A variant type representing either a successful result (Ok) or an error (Err).

      - **Backend Functions:**
         - `analyze_cv`: Accepts a text index and `CVUserInput`, returns a `CVResponse`.
         - `get_cv_analysis`: Retrieves a specific CV analysis based on index and user identifier.
         - `get_cv_aget_all_cv_analysis_for_identitynalysis`: Fetches all CV analyses for a specific user identity.
         - `delete_cv_analysis`: Deletes a specific CV analysis based on index and user identifier.

  ## Setting Up Your Environment

## User Authentication

User authentication is managed using the AuthClient from the @dfinity/auth-client library, which is a standard method for handling authentication on the Internet Computer. This ensures that user sessions are secure and that data access is properly restricted based on user identity.


## Error Handling

Errors in both grammar and CV analyses are managed through a structured Error type in the backend. The Error record contains a message field, providing details about the nature of the error, which helps in debugging and user feedback.


## Future Development Plans

1. Integration of additional AI models or services
2. Expansion of language support
3. Development of collaboration/multi-user features
4. Introduction of premium features or subscription-based services


## Conclusion

`Syntax` leverages AI to offer advanced grammar checking and CV enhancement functionalities. By integrating a robust Rust backend with a React.js frontend, `Syntax` provides users with an intuitive and effective tool for improving their written content and optimizing CVs for job applications. The use of ICP technology ensures scalability, security, and reliability, making `Syntax` a versatile tool for users looking to enhance their writing and job application materials.
